🧚🏽💻 Engineer, designer, and former librarian. My mixed background makes me a unique software engineer. I love blending technical skills with user empathy.

In the last 4+ years, I've:
- Developed scalable full-stack features using diverse technologies.
- Worked on generative AI projects tackling customer pain points.
- Promoted cross-functional collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking.
