🧚🏽💻 Engineer. Librarian. Transgender person. Mixing what I know from different worlds makes me a better software engineer. Sharing knowledge and creating are two of my favorite things.

My latest proyects are [emilia-about](https://github.com/Em3c2/emilia-about), [sande-landing](https://github.com/Em3c2/sande-landing) and starting [Junior Docs](https://github.com/Em3c2/junior-doc) 

🌱👀 I am looking to join part-time to projects with social or environmental impact.
